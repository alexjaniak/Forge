# Forge Dashboard

Next.js web dashboard for the Forge agent orchestration platform. Displays agent status, streams live logs via SSE, shows GitHub events, and lists live-updating GitHub issues.

## Setup

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Architecture

### App Router Structure

The dashboard is a single-page app built on Next.js App Router with server-side API routes that read directly from the filesystem.

### Components

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **ResizableLayout** | `resizable-layout.tsx` | Three-panel layout: sidebar (agents), top-right (logs), bottom-right (events). Panels are resizable with drag handles and collapsible on double-click. Sizes persist to localStorage. |
| **AgentPanel** | `agent-panel.tsx` | Lists agents with status badges (NEW, ACTIVE, MODIFIED, DELETED), role badges, interval/countdown info, and branch context. Supports add, delete, force-run, apply, clear, diff, and reset actions. Auto-refreshes every 5s. |
| **LogsPanel** | `logs-panel.tsx` | Streams logs via SSE (`/api/logs/stream`) with polling fallback (5s). The dashboard refresh control triggers an immediate refresh even when Logs is not the active tab. Tabs for each agent plus an "All" view. Parses log blocks delimited by `=== RUN ===` / `=== END RUN ===` markers. Max 200 blocks displayed. |
| **EventsPanel** | `events-panel.tsx` | Polls `/api/events` every 3s and refreshes immediately when the dashboard refresh control is clicked, even if Events is inactive. Shows GitHub event cards with action badges (color-coded), issue numbers, actors, labels. Max 50 events displayed. |
| **IssuesPanel** | `issues-panel.tsx` | Connects to `/api/issues/stream` for live issue snapshots with `/api/issues` polling fallback. The dashboard refresh control triggers an immediate refresh without disabling the live stream path, even when Issues is inactive. Shows GitHub issues with label badges (color-coded by status/role/type). Filterable by status, role, and type labels. Audio alert only when an issue newly gains `role:admin`. |

### Dashboard UX

- The right-side tab selection persists in the URL hash, so reloads and shared links reopen the same Logs, Events, or Issues tab.
- The dashboard refresh control immediately refreshes Logs, Events, and Issues, even when some of those tabs are inactive.

### Data Flow

```
Filesystem                          API Routes              Components
─────────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────   ──────────────
agent-kernel/cron/cron-jobs.json  → GET /api/agents       → AgentPanel
agent-kernel/cron/cron-state.json → GET /api/agents       → AgentPanel
agent-kernel/logs/{id}.log        → GET /api/logs/stream  → LogsPanel (SSE)
apps/webhook-monitor/events.jsonl → GET /api/events       → EventsPanel
gh issue list (via CLI)             → GET /api/issues       → IssuesPanel fallback
GitHub events JSONL                 → GET /api/issues/stream → IssuesPanel live snapshots
templates/{type}.json             → POST /api/agents      → (agent creation)
.worktrees/{id}/.agent.lock       → GET /api/agents       → (running detection)
```

All paths are resolved relative to the repo root via `src/lib/paths.ts`. The repo root defaults to two levels up from `apps/web/` unless `FORGE_REPO_ROOT` is set.

## API Routes

### `GET /api/agents`

Returns all agents with computed status and metadata. Reads staged config from `cron-jobs.json` and applied state from `cron-state.json`. Status is derived by comparing both:

- **new** — in staged config but not applied state yet
- **active** — in both with matching applied interval
- **modified** — in both, but one or more compared fields differ between staged and applied config (`interval`, `prompt`, `contexts`, `agentic`, `workspace`, `repo`, `runtime`, `model`)
- **deleted** — in applied state but removed from staged config

Running state is detected via `.agent.lock` PID files in agent worktrees.

### `POST /api/agents`

Creates a new agent. Body: `{ type: "<template-name>", id?: string, interval?: string }`. Loads defaults from `templates/{type}.json`, so any template in `templates/` is valid. Auto-generates ID as `{type}-{N}` if not provided.

### `DELETE /api/agents/[id]`

Removes an agent from the staged config.

### `POST /api/agents/[id]/force-run`

Spawns a detached background process running `run.sh` with the agent's config. Output goes to the agent's log file.

### `POST /api/agents/apply`

Runs `manage.py apply` to activate staged config changes. Returns stdout/stderr.

### `POST /api/agents/clear`

Resets staged config to empty.

### `GET /api/agents/diff`

Returns a field-level staged vs applied diff for agent records. Response shape is `{ hasDiff, agents }`, where each entry is tagged as `new`, `modified`, or `deleted`.

### `POST /api/agents/reset`

Rebuilds staged config from the currently applied state while preserving the top-level `stagger` setting from `cron-jobs.json`. If `cron-state.json` does not exist yet, reset treats the applied state as empty and clears staged-only changes instead of returning an error.

### `GET /api/logs/[agentId]?offset={n}`

Returns log content for a single agent starting from byte offset. On first read (offset=0), if the file exceeds 64KB only the last 64KB is returned. Agent ID is validated against `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$/` to prevent path traversal.

### `GET /api/logs/stream`

Server-Sent Events endpoint for live log streaming. Uses `fs.watch()` on log files and the logs directory. Optional `?agentId=` param to filter to one agent. Sends incremental chunks (max 64KB per event). Handles log rotation by detecting file truncation.

### `GET /api/events?offset={n}`

Returns up to 50 GitHub events from `apps/webhook-monitor/events.jsonl`, parsed from newline-delimited JSON.

### `GET /api/issues`
Returns open GitHub issues via `gh issue list`. Response cached server-side for 5s. Returns `{ issues, labels, repo }`, where `labels` is the hardcoded canonical `status`, `role`, and `type` label set defined in app source so the Issues tab can render filter chips even when a label has zero open matches.

### `GET /api/issues/stream`

Server-Sent Events endpoint for live issue snapshots. Sends an initial `{ issues, labels, repo }` snapshot immediately on connect, then emits updated snapshots when the GitHub event feed changes in ways that affect the Issues tab. The frontend falls back to polling `GET /api/issues` if the stream disconnects.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FORGE_REPO_ROOT` | No | Override repo root path. Defaults to `../../` relative to `apps/web/`. All data paths (logs, cron config, events) resolve from this root. |

No `.env` file is required. The app uses filesystem-based configuration exclusively.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server with hot reload (port 3000)
npm run build  # Production build
npm run start  # Start production server
npm run lint   # Run ESLint
